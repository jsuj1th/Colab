        "*Submission instructions (Canvas):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via Canvas (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",

        "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Canvas, search StackOverflow, even use ChatGPT. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. See the course syllabus for details.\n",

        "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

The Enron Email Dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron. The full corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). For this homework, we will use a small subset of the data. The subset contains 814 emails extracted from the `_sent_mail` of Arnold-J. We have zipped the 814 files (each file contains the information of an email). The zipped file is available on Canvas as `enron_814.zip`. The subset we provide is about 1.1MB. You should treat each email as a unique document to be indexed by your system. You can download the data from Canvas to your local filesystem. We're going to use these emails as the basis of OASIS, our Open Access Searchable Information System!\n",
