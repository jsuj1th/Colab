        "*Submission instructions (Canvas):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via Canvas (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",

        "\n",
        "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Canvas, search StackOverflow, even use ChatGPT. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. See the course syllabus for details.\n",

        "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

The Enron Email Dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron. The full corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). For this homework, we will use a small subset of the data. The subset contains 814 emails extracted from the `_sent_mail` of Arnold-J. We have zipped the 814 files (each file contains the information of an email). The zipped file is available on Canvas as `enron_814.zip`. The subset we provide is about 1.1MB. You should treat each email as a unique document to be indexed by your system. You can download the data from Canvas to your local filesystem. We're going to use these emails as the basis of OASIS, our Open Access Searchable Information System!\n",

Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on \\nv/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on \\nvalue, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between \\nhedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 \\ncents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is \\nworth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The \\nsame argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally \\nstrong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will \\nlag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because \\nevery equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 \\nwill average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j \\nblow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h \\nagain.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will \\nbe under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.

It is the way California deregulated, not \\nderegulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.\\nYet some economists argue that California\\'s troubles should inform the debate \\nabout whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, \\nthe Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free \\nmarkets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. \\n\\'\\'I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,\\'\\' Mr. Kahn said. \\nHe is still studying whether the design flaws in California\\'s market explain \\nthe whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. \\n\\'\\'I\\'ve always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,\\'\\' he \\nsaid, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power \\ncompany to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. \\'\\'It may be one \\nindustry in which it works reasonably well.\\'\\' \\nMr. Kahn\\'s comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter \\nadministration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and \\npolitically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses \\nis part of the Washington economic canon. \\nMoreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its \\nelectricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To \\nsatisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which \\nsoured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went \\non the auction block. \\nAmong the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power \\non daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might \\nhave allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it \\nimpossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. \\nPaul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts \\nInstitute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn\\'s, remains hopeful \\nthat the kinks can be ironed out. \\nIn New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, \\nChile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, \\nregulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found \\nways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and \\ncharge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. \\nRegulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price \\nsignals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so \\nthat they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and \\nprice spikes can substantially raise average prices. \\n\\'\\'If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do \\nit here,\\'\\' Mr. Joskow said. \\nStill, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. \\nAllowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure \\nNimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. \\n\\'\\'The political system must rise to the task,\\'\\' Mr. Joskow said, or the \\'\\'old \\nway might be the best we can do.\\'\\' \\nMr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970\\'s, he headed the New \\nYork Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated \\nindustries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic \\ntendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which \\nconsumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that \\ncompetition would slash prices. \\nBut though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline \\nprices, they have yet to match regulators\\' ability to juggle the complexities \\nof electricity, Mr. Kahn said. \\nRegulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep \\nprices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical \\nintegration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn \\nsaid. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal \\nways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them \\nto be built. \\'\\'The players all depended on one another,\\'\\' he said. \\nCalifornia has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made \\npeople wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for \\nwidgets.\\n\\nPhoto: Alfred E. Kahn \\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As chairman of Enron Corp., the world\\'s largest energy \\ntrader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. \\nBut that\\'s not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn\\'t like taking \\nknocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California\\'s energy \\nmess.\\n\"It\\'s very unfair,\" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. \\n\"He\\'s trying to vilify us. But we didn\\'t make the rules in California. We had \\nnothing to do with creating the problem.\" \\nHe gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston\\'s downtown \\nskyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. \\n\"Everyone played by the rules,\" Lay said. \"Now our reputations are being \\nmaligned.\" \\nIn a sense, he\\'s right. The ultimate blame does rest with California \\npolicymakers for deregulating the state\\'s electricity market in such a \\nham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting \\nloopholes in the system. \\nBut Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. \\n\"Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for \\nderegulation in California,\" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst \\nin the Austin office of Consumers Union. \"A lot of what\\'s happening in \\nCalifornia was their idea.\" \\nThose familiar with the state\\'s deregulation efforts said Enron was \\nespecially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where \\nwholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent \\nSystem Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. \\n\"This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,\" said \\nJohn Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as \\nthe godfather of California\\'s bungled deregulation measures. \\n\"Enron isn\\'t in the business of making markets work,\" Rozsa said. \"They\\'re in \\nthe business of making a buck.\" \\nIn an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping \\nthe state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has \\nthat much clout. \\nSEEKING LAY\\'S BLESSING \\nThus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission \\nlines of California\\'s cash-strapped utilities, he didn\\'t hesitate to call \\nrecently seeking Lay\\'s personal blessing for the plan. \\nThis must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had \\nbeen castigated by Davis in the governor\\'s State of the State speech. \\n\"I told him we couldn\\'t support it,\" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing \\nacross his lips. \"It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid \\nand, longer term, it could make things worse.\" \\nWhy would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron\\'s big cheese? \\nSimple: Davis will need the Bush administration\\'s backing to make the \\npower-line sale fly, and, many believe, there\\'s no faster way to reach the \\nnew president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. \\nLay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush\\'s various \\npolitical campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron\\'s private jet at \\nBush\\'s disposal during the presidential race. \\nSo great is Lay\\'s influence with the president that some insist he is now \\nserving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as \\nhe sees fit. \\n\"There\\'s a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political \\nrelationships to get what it wants,\" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans \\nfor Public Justice, a watchdog group. \"What Ken Lay thinks energy policy \\nshould be isn\\'t very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it \\nshould be.\" \\nANOTHER VIEWPOINT \\nLay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close \\nrapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited \\nthe words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. \\n\"I have known the president and his family for many years,\" Lay said. \"I\\'ve \\nbeen a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his \\npolicies.\" \\nHe insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are \\n\"grossly exaggerated.\" \\nStill, it is striking that Bush\\'s quick decision after taking office to limit \\nfederal assistance in solving California\\'s energy woes virtually mirrored \\nLay\\'s own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration\\'s \\nhands-off approach to resolving the crisis. \\nWhatever else, California\\'s power woes have been very kind to Enron\\'s bottom \\nline. The company\\'s revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. \\nThey haven\\'t hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package \\nmore than tripled last year to $18.3 million. \\nLay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company\\'s \\nCalifornia earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay \\nconceded that Enron\\'s profit from California energy deals last year was \"not \\ninconsequential.\" \\n\"We benefit from the volatility,\" he said. \\nCAPTIVE MARKETPLACE \\nThat\\'s putting it mildly. It could be said that California\\'s energy mess was \\ntailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a \\ncaptive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are \\nsimultaneously soaring skyward. \\nTo understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron\\'s complex business \\nmodel. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy \\ndeals. \\nLay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy \\nregulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over \\nwhat was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. \\nAs he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of \\nenergy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas \\nis needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. \\nEnron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage \\nto consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers \\nand sellers throughout the country. \\nIt also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually \\ncreative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas \\nprices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility\\'s power needs in return \\nfor taking possession of the gas required to run the utility\\'s plants. \\nEnron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the \\nproceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it \\nships back to the original utility. \\n\"We do best in competitive markets,\" Lay said. \"These are sustainable \\nmarkets.\" \\nTRADING FRENZY \\nEnron\\'s trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly \\nyoung, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of \\nthe best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost \\nfrat-party atmosphere. \\nThe company\\'s trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an \\nInternet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 \\nbillion, making Enron by far the world\\'s single biggest e-commerce entity. \\nKevin Presto, who oversees Enron\\'s East Coast power trades, called up the \\nCalifornia electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, \\nhe showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at \\n$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. \\n\"Some days we\\'re at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,\" Presto said \\nover the steady thump-thump of the trading floor\\'s rock \\'n\\' roll soundtrack. \\n\"There\\'s truly a problem out there.\" \\nThis is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California\\'s electricity \\nmarket is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. As \\nLay himself put it, \"The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace.\" \\nIn reality, California\\'s dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn\\'t just \\nmaking piles of money, it\\'s seeing profits both coming and going. \\nLOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA \\nThe company\\'s energy services division, which handles the complete energy \\nneeds of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of \\nCalifornia and California State school systems, Oakland\\'s Clorox Co., and \\neven the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. \\nEnron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and \\nElectric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market \\nvalues. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale \\nlevels. \\nIn other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a \\nfraction of the price it charges the utility. \\n\"These guys are the pariahs of the power system,\" said Nettie Hoge, executive \\ndirector of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. \"Why do we need \\nmiddlemen? They don\\'t do anything except mark up the cost.\" \\nTo be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient \\nmarketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. \\nThis has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among \\nabout 200 market participants. \\nBut in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can \\neasily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state\\'s ill-conceived \\nregulatory framework. \\nSylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state \\ncommittee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can\\'t blame Enron and other \\npower companies for pursuing profits in California. \\n\"California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules \\nCalifornia set up,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, they will behave to \\nenhance their bottom lines.\" \\nBut as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next \\nyear, Turner said he has learned from California\\'s experience -- and is \\ntaking steps to prevent Texas\\' power giants from shaking down local \\nconsumers. \\nLESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE \\nHe has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission \\nmore authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are \\nfighting the legislation as hard as they can. \\nNot least among Turner\\'s worries is that Texas will see what California \\nofficials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power \\nby leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. \\n\"I have that concern,\" he said. \"I don\\'t necessarily take these companies at \\ntheir word.\" \\nFor his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated \\nelectricity prices. \\n\"I don\\'t know of any of that,\" he said. \"It\\'s so easy to conjure up \\nconspiracy theories.\" \\nAs a sign of Enron\\'s commitment to solving California\\'s energy troubles, Lay \\nsaid he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power \\ncontracts on behalf of utilities. \\nSo how many contracts has Enron signed? \\nSuddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay\\'s face, and a \\nharder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. \\n\"None,\" he said. \"We won\\'t be signing until we\\'re certain about recovering \\nour costs.\" \\nConsider this a shot across California\\'s bow.\\n\\nPHOTO; Caption: Chairman Kenneth Lay said Enron had \"nothing to do with \\ncreating the (energy) problem.\" \\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from \\nCalifornia\\'s energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he \\nshouldn\\'t be a scapegoat in California\\'s energy crisis. \\nThat hasn\\'t swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as \\nHouston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California.\\n\"Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians \\nhostage,\" Davis warned in his State of the State address. \\nMore recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state \\nlooks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. \\n\"I told him we couldn\\'t support it,\" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in \\nan interview at his Houston office. \"It will lead to an even less efficient \\ntransmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse.\" \\nLay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world\\'s \\nlargest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay \\nand his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush\\'s various \\npolitical campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron\\'s \\nprivate jet during the presidential race. \\nBut Lay said it\\'s economics, not politics, that matter in California\\'s energy \\ncrisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy \\nbrokers for the protracted problems. \\n\"We didn\\'t make the rules in California,\" Lay said. \"We had nothing to do \\nwith creating the problem.\" \\nThe problem, many analysts agree, began with the state\\'s deregulation of the \\npower industry in 1996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state\\'s \\nensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. \\nEnron\\'s stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to \\n$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 \\nmillion in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared \\nwith less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. \\nLay refused to say how much Enron has made off California\\'s crisis, though he \\nconceded the profit was \"not inconsequential.\" \\n\"We benefit from the volatility,\" said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and \\nhas helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of \\nelectricity as a commodity. \\nBut Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by \\ninsisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep \\nthe lights on in recent months. \\n\"I don\\'t know of any of that,\" he said. \"It\\'s so easy to conjure up \\nconspiracy theories.\"\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. \\nThe home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if \\nEdison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, \\nruns out of juice. \\nOf course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens \\nor hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a \\nballpark or arena. \\nIn fact, many were at their peak. \\nWhich begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which \\nthey own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? \\nBrian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if \\ncompanies are susceptible to some weird strain of the \"Sports Illustrated \\ncurse.\" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI \\nmagazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. \\nBusiness celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief \\nExecutive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine\\'s 1999 person of the \\nyear just before his company\\'s stock price tanked. \\nDon Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn\\'t \\nthink the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. \\n\"You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming \\nrights sponsorship, but you can\\'t necessarily say it corresponds with a peak \\nin its business,\" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham \\nGroup in Denver. \\nTRACKING NAMING FIRMS \\nTo find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of \\npublicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league \\nsports venues in North America. \\nI excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including \\nMiller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac \\nBell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, \\nwhich is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). \\nI used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals \\nare, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates \\ntons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is \\nnegative and even if the stadium won\\'t open for several years. \\nThen I compared each company\\'s stock market performance with the Standard & \\nPoor\\'s 500 index during the same period. \\nThe bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names \\nare trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, \\naccording to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought \\ntwo names and were counted twice.) \\nBut -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the \\nperiod since their respective deals were announced. \\nSo buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it\\'s no guarantee the \\ncompany will beat the market. \\nWINNERS, LOSERS \\nThe companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide \\nvariety of industries. \\nThe biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. \\nAlthough its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it\\'s still up 746 \\npercent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. \\nThe next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom \\nequipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and \\nEnron (energy). \\nThe biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI \\n(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network \\nAssociates (network security software). \\nNetwork Associates\\' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming \\nrights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered \\na string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned \\nits accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and \\n1998. Its CEO resigned in December. \\nNetwork Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the \\ncoliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. \\nThe company \"has been paying us,\" says Deena McClain, general counsel with \\nthe Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. \"We haven\\'t had any \\ndiscussions with them\" about changing the contract. \\nMost naming-rights contracts have \"out clauses that allow the parties to \\nextricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial \\ndifficulties or if a team moves,\" says Hinchey. \\nAlthough nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may \\nbenefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. \\nThat\\'s because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, \\nwhen $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. \\nIn 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of \\nthe Washington Redskins. \\nIn 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on \\nthe new home of the New England Patriots. It\\'s questionable what kind of \\nshape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. \\nThe \"10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,\" says Hinchey, is in Houston, \\nwhere Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the \\nAstrodome and a new football stadium after itself. \\nSome customers of Reliant\\'s utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal \\nwas announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. \\nSome shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a \\nstadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. \\nBut Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, \"you have to \\nlook at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds \\nlike big money, but frequently it\\'s over 20 to 30 years. If you take out \\nthings the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it\\'s \\nsmall potatoes.\" \\nWHAT A DEAL IS WORTH \\nThe main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game \\nis broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. \\n\"This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,\" says Jennifer \\nKeavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. \\nShe says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, \"won\\'t even buy you a \\nSuper Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised \\nfootball game, maybe.\" \\nThe Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard \\nfor the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. \\nHinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site \\nexposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might \\noffer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. \\nMost companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name \\nbecause they sell consumer products or services. \\nBut not always. \\n3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to \\nCandlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. \\n\"It was a good move for them,\" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from \\nSports Venues. \"They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility \\nthey were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, \\nand they wanted to look like a fun place to work.\" \\nLast April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. \\nThe biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility \\nwill be a loser. \\n\"Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and \\nhospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not \\nperforming well,\" Hinchey says. \"But corporations realize the team\\'s success \\non the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the \\ndumps.\" \\nThe same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium \\nowners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they \\nsell a name.\\n\\n\\nPHOTO; Caption: Rich Gannon of the Oakland Raiders scored in Oakland\\'s \\nNetwork Associates Coliseum last year. / Frederic Larson/The Chronicle 2000 \\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Then it saw a better\\ndeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\\nunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is\\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\\npays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.\\nIt is a measure of this winter\\'s fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in\\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even\\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large\\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they\\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum\\nand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to\\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\\n\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don\\'t know\\nwhat they\\'re going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chief\\neconomist at Standard & Poor\\'s. Some economists have recently increased\\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter\\'s heating bills on\\nan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated\\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a\\ntypical U.S. household.\\nThat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\\nenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected\\ngrowth in the nation\\'s economic output by one percentage point on an annual\\nrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energy\\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\\nslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in\\nSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use\\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the\\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\\nDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,\\nwhich are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its\\nexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative\\nofficer.\\n\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, \\'This is crazy,\\' \" he said.\\nTerra hasn\\'t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but\\nRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra\\'s good\\nfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the\\nprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\\npoint. That would keep Terra\\'s plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate\\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"\\nRosenbury said, \"it\\'s going to be a real problem.\"\\nHe estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18\\nmillion tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn\\'t operating\\nnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It\\'s possible that\\nfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark\\nInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and\\ndistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,\\nindefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next\\nmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\\ncontinued production. \"We believe it\\'s likely this is a speculative bubble\\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we\\'ll be able to\\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said Paul\\nM. Murphy, the company\\'s managing director for financial planning. A\\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers\\' decisions to\\nplant feed corn, he said. \"It\\'s sticker shock.\"\\nAccording to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the\\naluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the\\nindustry\\'s No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O\\'Carroll, an\\nanalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.\\nAluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,\\nand December\\'s production will be lower still, he said. \"We\\'ll get more\\nproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and\\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\\nsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn\\'t fall completely apart, then\\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more\\nthan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser\\'s case, it\\'s an open question\\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually\\nentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,\\nsays spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville\\nfor $550 a megawatt hour for December.\\nBut the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future\\nprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,\\nto invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to\\nBonneville\\'s other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and\\nBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after\\nnext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries\\nto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Out\\nhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an\\nethical dimension to this and we\\'re not shy in trying to make sure they live\\nup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Mosey\\nsaid.\\n, 2000 The Washington Post Company\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '14691398.1075857595631': 'careful...i\\'m having another bad day\\n\\n\\nFrom: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 10/25/2000 02:42 PM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re:  \\n\\nWell, well, well... just for that sassy response, I might have to come flirt \\nwith you today!  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tJohn Arnold@ECT\\n\\t10/25/2000 02:34 PM\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t To: Margaret Allen/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\n\\t\\t cc: \\n\\t\\t Subject: Re:\\n\\nDon\\'t even think you\\'re getting out of this with the \"for a while\" crap.  \\nJust for that you can add a star to the place we\\'re going.\\n\\n\\nFrom: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 10/25/2000 01:34 PM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re:  \\n\\nHum, while it would be very interesting to see how you act on a date I think \\nI\\'ll have to pass.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\\n\\nAcquiring a Company\\n\\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\\nviability\\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\\nA,\\nand so on.\\n\\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for Company T\\'s shares.  This offer must be made now,\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press.\\n\\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\\nanything less than $50.\\n\\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T\\'s\\nstock?\\n\\n     $______ per/share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '8261654.1075857597475': 'Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product \\npriced at parity to NYMEX.

Disagree about the demand \\ndestruction. \\n? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- \\nPacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are \\nunderestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy \\nis less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is \\nchanging. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power \\ndemand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on \\nwhat the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying \\nis  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries \\nwill increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure \\nin service industries.\\n? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have \\nimagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly \\nentrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. \\nAlso they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50\\n? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- \\nincreases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their \\nplans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the \\nbright lights business'\\n? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom\\n First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much \\nworse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates \\nthis week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar \\nwhich will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will \\nnot tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction \\nin big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this \\nis not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming \\nmore service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the \\nwhole story.\\n?

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\\n\\nAcquiring a Company\\n\\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\\nviability\\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\\nA,\\nand so on.\\n\\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for Company T\\'s shares.  This offer must be made now,\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press.\\n\\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\\nanything less than $50.\\n\\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T\\'s\\nstock?\\n\\n     $______ per/share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '13385806.1075857596888': \"I've got your tix.

Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point\\non v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily\\ntrade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes\\nequilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k\\ncash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet\\nthat's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get\\nthere k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will\\nbe exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last\\nyear.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are\\nselling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling\\ntheir customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z\\nspreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there\\nright mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary\\njuice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a\\nseller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.

The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share\\nof one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding\\nfor the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted\\nearnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second\\nquarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million\\nin the year-ago period.\\nEBIT from the company\\'s non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the\\nquarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.\\n``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in\\nour other non-regulated segments produced these record results,\\'\\' said\\nWilliam A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy\\nCorporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio\\nof flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy\\'s earnings continued to\\naccelerate in the second quarter.\\'\\'\\nFor the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share\\nincreased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first\\nsix months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding\\nnon-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515\\nmillion in the year-ago period.\\nSecond Quarter Business Segment Results\\nThe Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the\\nsecond quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year\\nand $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas\\nand power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating\\nsignificant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced\\ntrading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale\\ncustomer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company\\'s\\noff-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed\\nto the record second-quarter performance.\\nThe Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT\\nto $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher\\nrealized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the\\nreorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for\\nthe quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and\\n$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from\\nthe year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day\\nand oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.\\nThe Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,\\nnearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due\\nprimarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with\\nthe acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March\\n2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion\\nBtu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.\\nComing out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas\\nTransmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared\\nwith an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost\\nsavings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3\\nTBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement\\nfiled in March.\\nThe International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million\\ncompared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in\\nBrazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company\\'s\\ninvestment in the Philippines.\\nTelecom Update\\n``We have made substantial progress in the development of our\\ntelecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,\\'\\' said William A.\\nWise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,\\nwe have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant\\nEnergy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building\\nbusinesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant\\nEnergy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the\\ntelecommunications marketplace.\\'\\'\\nQuarterly Dividend\\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on\\nthe company\\'s outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October\\n2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September\\n1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled\\nto receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.\\nWith over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides\\ncomprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:\\nTennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern\\nNatural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy\\nInternational Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso\\nProduction Company.

Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.\\n\\nUnless you\\'re outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you\\ncan\\'t see\\nyour breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin\\nbox for the\\nright to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,\\nMurphy Oil\\nCorp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred\\nthousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same\\nstuff you\\nexhaled three sentences ago.\\n\\nThe reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that\\nsame autumn\\nday, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and\\nscientists\\nfrom all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i\\'s, cross the\\nzeds and\\numlaut the o\\'s on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework\\nConvention on\\nClimate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission\\nof six\\ngases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological\\nterms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was\\nreached.\\n\\nIn this context, Murphy\\'s purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of\\ncarbon\\n(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a\\nCanadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target\\nseems a\\nbit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn\\'t been established, and\\nthere isn\\'t\\neven a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed\\nthere\\nisn\\'t even unanimity on global warming itself.\\n\\nYet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an\\nenvironmental\\ntransition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global\\nbureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions\\ntrading\\nsystem. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to\\nconfront the\\nclimate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.\\nJohn Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal\\nDutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and\\nset up\\ninternal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have\\nvowed\\nto cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto\\ntarget--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. \"This isn\\'t an act of altruism,\" says\\nAidan\\nMurphy of Shell. \"It\\'s a fundamental strategic issue for our business.\"\\n\\nAnd not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your\\nneighborhood Kinko\\'s, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPont\\nis\\npledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. \"There\\'s\\nbeen a\\nshift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since\\nKyoto,\" says\\nAlden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Now the view is that\\nclimate\\nchange is serious and we ought to do something about it.\"\\n\\nThere are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources\\nand \"cap\\nand trade\" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas\\nemission\\nand let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their\\nallowance or\\nbuy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that the\\npursuit of\\ngreenbacks will fuel greener business. \"Whenever you turn a pollution\\ncut into a\\nfinancial asset,\" says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental\\nDefense,\\n\"people go out and make lots of pollution cuts.\"\\n\\nEven where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing\\nthe\\npotential for global regulation as a business risk they need to\\nconsider. Witness\\nClaiborne Deming, Murphy\\'s CEO, who doesn\\'t see the science of global\\nwarming\\nas solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholders\\nclamoring and\\nthe bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than a\\nquarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted\\namount of CO2.\\n\\nBreathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.\\n\\nHow much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that\\'s analogous\\nto the\\none businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figure\\nit out,\\ncompanies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how\\nyou\\nbuy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)\\nhow to do\\nso when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. \"It\\'s risky as\\nhell,\" says\\nDeming.\\n\\nMany groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World Resources\\nInstitute\\nand others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky\\nby\\ncreating universal carbon-accounting practices. And four\\ncompanies--Arthur\\nAndersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an\\nexchange\\nwhere companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of\\nlegislative\\nstandards. \"They\\'re trying to nail down something that will be useful\\nunder laws\\nthat are not yet defined,\" says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an\\nenergy-trading firm.\\n\\nThe U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto\\nProtocol,\\nand achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:\\nbringing\\nemissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of the\\ncurrent\\nsituation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,\\nhave become\\nits champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark\\non a\\nnational trading system.\\n\\nAnother practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for\\nsequestering carbon\\nin growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen\\ninto the\\nair and turn carbon into wood.\\n\\nThe Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thus\\nsetting up\\nan early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned against\\nthe\\ndocument. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard\\npreliminary\\nbriefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,\\nto be held in\\nBonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990,\\nwhen he\\nsigned legislation that capped power plants\\' sulfur dioxide\\nemissions--the main\\ningredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. And\\nHouston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was a\\nprominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any such\\nmarket.\\nSo if it\\'s good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won\\'t need that\\nbig a push.\\n\\nWith him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for\\ngreed\\'s sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. For\\nyou, it\\'s\\nstill free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running\\nsoon. In the\\nvery near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an\\nopportunity.\\n  \\n', '20067564.1075857597692': \"Hello:\\nI am John Arnold.

The approach we\\'re \\ntaking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each \\nENA organization\\'s records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually \\na vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain \\nthis project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We\\'ll then ask \\nthat executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our \\nworking contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with \\ntheir department\\'s record, and can be a manager or support staff.\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. \\nEnron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic \\nrecords--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. \\nMany departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention \\nrequirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, \\nonce completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility \\nfor it, and how long it must be maintained.\\n\\nEnron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an \\nimaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and \\nthen use the \"imaged\" document viewable from your computer as the working \\ncopy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to \\noffsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. \\n\\nDuring our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic \\nrecords. We\\'ll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. \\nMSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we \\ndo not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It\\'s simply an \\ninterview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.\\n\\n If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  \\nThank you.\\n\\nSara Bolken\\nX35150\\n\\n\\n', '27677135.1075857653981': \"you'll be happy to know i get my car back today\", '3892040.1075857598810': '---------------------- Forwarded by John Arnold/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 06:59 \\nPM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\n\"Zerilli, Frank\" <fzerilli@POWERMERCHANTS.COM> on 09/06/2000 06:46:47 AM\\nTo: \"\\'jarnold@enron.com\\'\" <jarnold@enron.com>\\ncc:  \\nSubject: concord Crash\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n concord\\n\\n - concord.jpg\\n', '15720273.1075857651616': 'mike:\\njust want to confirm you received my money and forms.\\nalso, checking to see if i am set up to sell naked calls on ENE.  may be \\nlooking to do something this week.  probably 100-200 contracts.  \\njohn', '11329002.1075857653130': \"thanks, i'll check it out\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFletcher Sturm <trademup@yahoo.com> on 03/28/2001 08:41:40 PM\\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\\ncc:  \\nSubject: missing a couple jumbos?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\njohnny,\\n\\nmy new deal p/l from yesterday (tue) looked a little on the high side,?so i \\nasked my?guy to double check my deals.? he checked them today and said they \\nall checked out.? but, i re-checked?my new gas deals and saw that you filled \\nme on 100 n-q at 4.32 instead of 5.32.? i'll have my boy fix it so it'll show \\nup tomorrow (thur).? $2 jumbos from me to you!\\n\\nfletch\\n\\np.s.? thanks for all your help with our gas business.?it gives us a \\ntremendous advantage against our rivals. you're the king even if you don't \\nnotice a $2 million error on one trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nYahoo!

My ultimate goal is to move all volume to \\nEOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable \\nelectronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if \\npossible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater \\nthan our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to \\nbuy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move \\nmy market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the \\ntrade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade \\nto him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other \\nsystems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on \\nthe other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.\\n\\nI mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on \\nSpectron's system.

(the code is \"NG-OPT-XL-PRC\")\\nFor example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: \\nJune 1st  $797 million dollars loss\\nJune 2nd +192 million dollars made\\nJune 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)\\n\\nThis problem makes it impossible to backtest....\\n\\nSecond, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the \\nallocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily \\nincreasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until \\nJuly 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution \\ncan be devised..... \\n\\nI hope this helps.\\nThanks,\\nFrank\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Arnold@ECT\\n07/14/2000 02:33 PM\\nTo: Frank Hayden/Corp/Enron@Enron\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: \\n\\nFrank:\\nJust following up on two topics.\\nOne: Larry May\\'s book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact \\nhis P&L is never close to that.

If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, \\nmaking the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 \\ncent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller \\nsize than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower \\ndelta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a \\nmarket in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the \\nmoney.  \\nMaybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way \\nwrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is \\n4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is \\n3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a \\nstrike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate \\nhaving to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.\\n\\nIn terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles \\nstruck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for \\nwhat I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying \\nto rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier \\nfor the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more \\nsense.

He tracks all the plant \\nclosures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a \\nmore comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track \\nthis number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic \\nconditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number \\nfor turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does \\nnot seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for \\nthe summer.\\n\\nWhile he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels\\nHe firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) \\nbased on his relationship with the producing community although I personally \\nthink that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking \\nthese numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q \\nover 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.\\n\\nHe really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, \\ncrude/propane....\\n\\n+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 \\nstorage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the \\nbackwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower \\nbaseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn \\non this one.\\n\\n+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same \\nanalysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long \\nnat gas!! through vol or outright.\\n\\n+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas \\njust crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM \\nissues- they like to look out in the calendar years. \\n\\n+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: \\nMoore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance \\n(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, \\nI'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.\\n\\nHave a great holiday!

This\\nstandard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic\\ndevelopers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and\\nexamining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and\\nmore effective economic development decisions as communities will be more\\ncomparable than ever before.\\n\\nA copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to\\nsee how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25\\ntables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the\\nbottom of the page will access the additional tables.\\n\\nYou can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use\\nthe services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into\\na strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for\\nthe standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the\\nstandard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which\\napproach works best for you.\\n\\nAdoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic\\ndevelopment profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many\\nareas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven\\'t\\nreceived the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to\\ntell their story.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like more information on the use of the standards, look for\\nnotices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC\\'s National Seminars on the\\nstandards and their use.\\n\\nPaul Lawler\\nAEDC\\n\\n - SSDSTF Datatables 97 June 00.xls\\n\\n', '7181067.1075857602318': 'I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better \\nreplicate seasonal fundamentals.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\\n\\nAcquiring a Company\\n\\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\\nviability\\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\\nA,\\nand so on.\\n\\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for Company T\\'s shares.  This offer must be made now,\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press.\\n\\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\\nanything less than $50.\\n\\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T\\'s\\nstock?\\n\\n     $______ per/share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '5850542.1075857652496': 'i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer \\nversus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 \\nand contango for natty?\\n\\n\\nFrom: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/27/2001 06:55 PM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Alex Mcleish/EU/Enron@Enron, Richard Lassander/ENRON@enronXgate \\nSubject: Incremental Fuel Switching For Distillate-- Summer Estimate\\n\\nGiven the shape of the curve, my guess for incremental substitution is \\n1.5Bcf/d for No2 oil.  \\nSo for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into the \\nsystem due to No2 oil usage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFutures Settlements                                          \\t\\tMar27-01\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tNG\\tCL\\tBRT\\tHO\\tGSL\\tHU\\tPN\\t\\n\\t$/Mmbtu\\t$/BBL\\t$/BBL\\tCts/Gal\\t$/ MT\\tCts/Gal\\tCts/gal\\t\\nAPR1\\t5.621\\t 27.75 \\t25.40\\t0.7794\\t216.25\\t0.9395\\t0.5375\\t\\nMAY1\\t5.661\\t 27.84 \\t25.50\\t0.737\\t213.75\\t0.9306\\t0.5375\\t\\nJUN1\\t5.703\\t 27.66 \\t25.39\\t0.7235\\t212.25\\t0.9111\\t0.5400\\t\\nJUL1\\t5.738\\t 27.40 \\t25.26\\t0.724\\t212.50\\t0.8853\\t0.5425\\t\\nAUG1\\t5.753\\t 27.12 \\t25.09\\t0.727\\t213.00\\t0.8558\\t0.5450\\t\\nSEP1\\t5.713\\t 26.85 \\t24.91\\t0.7325\\t213.00\\t0.819\\t0.5475\\t\\nOCT1\\t5.708\\t 26.58 \\t24.73\\t0.739\\t213.50\\t0.7765\\t0.5575\\t\\nNOV1 \\t5.813\\t 26.31 \\t24.53\\t0.745\\t214.25\\t0.7525\\t0.5600\\t\\nDEC1\\t5.913\\t 26.03 \\t24.27\\t0.7490\\t215.00\\t0.739\\t0.5600\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFutures Settlements  DIFFS VS NG (USD/ MMBTU)   (CDTY- \\nNG)                                    \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tNG\\tCL\\tBRT\\tHO\\tGSL\\tHU\\tPN\\n\\t$/MMBtu\\t$/MMBtu\\t$/MMBtu\\t$/MMBtu\\t$/MMBtu\\t$/MMBtu\\t$/MMBtu\\nAPR1\\t0.00\\t-0.86\\t-1.29\\t0.00\\t-0.64\\t2.19\\t0.28\\nMAY1\\t0.00\\t-0.88\\t-1.32\\t-0.35\\t-0.74\\t2.08\\t0.24\\nJUN1\\t0.00\\t-0.95\\t-1.38\\t-0.49\\t-0.81\\t1.87\\t0.22\\nJUL1\\t0.00\\t-1.03\\t-1.43\\t-0.52\\t-0.84\\t1.62\\t0.22\\nAUG1\\t0.00\\t-1.10\\t-1.48\\t-0.51\\t-0.84\\t1.36\\t0.23\\nSEP1\\t0.00\\t-1.10\\t-1.47\\t-0.43\\t-0.80\\t1.10\\t0.41\\nOCT1\\t0.00\\t-1.14\\t-1.50\\t-0.38\\t-0.79\\t0.75\\t0.44\\nNOV1 \\t0.00\\t-1.30\\t-1.63\\t-0.44\\t-0.88\\t0.45\\t#REF!\\nDEC1\\t0.00\\t-1.44\\t-1.78\\t-0.51\\t-0.96\\t0.23\\t0.23\\n\\nDate\\t27-03\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nLegend\\t\\t\\nNG\\tNYMEX Nat Gas\\t\\nCL\\tNYMEX Crude Oil\\t\\nBRT\\tIPE Brent\\t\\nHO\\tNYMEX Heating Oil\\t\\nGSL\\tIPE Gasoil\\t\\nHU\\tNYMEX Gasoline\\t\\nPN\\t1 BBL = 42 Gal\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nDate\\t27-03\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nConversions\\t\\t\\nNG\\t1 BBL = 5.825 MMBtu\\t\\nCL\\t\\t\\nBRT\\t\\t\\nHO\\t1 BBL = 42 Gal\\t\\nGSL\\t1 BBL =0.134 MT\\t\\nHU\\t1 BBL = 42 Gal\\t\\nPN\\t1 BBL = 42 Gal\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nJen Fraser\\nEnron Global Markets Fundamentals\\n713-853-4759\\n\\n\\n', '28132009.1075857653327': \"We ahave not initiated a 24/7 gas product yet but are creating the \\ncapabilities to launch at some point in the near future\\n\\n\\nFrom: Frank Hayden/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/22/2001 10:49 AM\\nTo: Geoff Storey/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: FW: Rick Buy Report Tomorrow--Your comments needed\\n\\nI received this email and they are inquiring as to the new gas 24/7 \\nelectronic trading.

I think consensus \\nopinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the \\nwinter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection \\nseason with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those \\nprojections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to \\nprice in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the \\nequation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand \\n(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies \\nwill be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as \\nto whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a \\ncomfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number \\nindicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  \\nCertainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be \\na function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting \\nnoise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand \\nequilibrium.

Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at\\n> roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the\\n> end of the traditional withdrawal season.\\n> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this\\n> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or\\n> production added per rig.\\n> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other\\n> variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and\\n> industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning\\n> of winter will be near or below last year\\'s 2,800 Bcf level.\\n> 4. Thus, it appears likely that the \"heat\" will remain on natural gas\\n> prices throughout 2001.\\n> 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&P shares will post solid gains\\n> again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the\\n> sustainability of strong natural gas prices.\\n>\\n>\\n\\n - 2001 Natural Gas Conference Call.doc\\n', '31687091.1075857596564': \"Oh yea, I always get those two places confused.\\n\\n\\nFrom: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 10/13/2000 04:26 PM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re: Last night  \\n\\nI thought we agreed to Denny's tonight after Rick's?!\\n\\n\", '15177997.1075857649898': \"i need significant lead time to prepare for boots day.  please advise earlier \\nnext time.\\n\\n\\nFrom: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 05/11/2001 06:09 PM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re:   \\n\\nI'll be here until tomorrow afternoon, then off to Waco to see my mom.

If so, what level of person?\\n2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?\\n3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?\\n4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want \\nto plan for?\\n5) Are you expecting any promotions?\\n6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement \\nagencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?\\n7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?\\n8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should \\nplan for?  If so, how much and where?\\n9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, \\nmonitors and software?\\n10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should \\nplan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)\\n\\nMy last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished \\nbefore Paula Harris took over.

All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great\\nLakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold\\nPolar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by\\ndays 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and\\nEuropean continue more troughing in the southern branch in the\\nSouthwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued\\nridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping\\nthem warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this\\nsouthern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian\\nbreaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold\\nweather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears\\nto hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,\\nthe West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.\\nAll three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada\\nwith a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.\\n\\nMore details, including early information from the ensembles, will be\\navailable with the 6:30am ET release.\\n\\n-Matt Rogers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '21424376.1075857602147': \"are you sure...have you ever been to bon coupe before\\ndon't knock it till tou try it\", '21423992.1075857649832': 'and your offer?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eva Pao\" <epao@mba2002.hbs.edu> on 05/13/2001 02:58:28 PM\\nPlease respond to <epao@mba2002.hbs.edu>\\nTo: <John.Arnold@enron.com>\\ncc:  \\nSubject: RE: Extra credit\\n\\n\\n1.99999999999999999999999999999999999\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: John.Arnold@enron.com [mailto:John.Arnold@enron.com]\\nSent: Sunday, May 13, 2001 4:37 PM\\nTo: epao@mba2002.hbs.edu\\nSubject: Re: Extra credit\\n\\n\\n\\nrules to a game:\\nYou flip a coin.

If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server \\nautomatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we \\nimmediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as \\nit is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on \\nICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market \\ngets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was \\nthat if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.

Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at\\n> roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the\\n> end of the traditional withdrawal season.\\n> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this\\n> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or\\n> production added per rig.\\n> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other\\n> variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and\\n> industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning\\n> of winter will be near or below last year\\'s 2,800 Bcf level.\\n> 4. Thus, it appears likely that the \"heat\" will remain on natural gas\\n> prices throughout 2001.\\n> 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&P shares will post solid gains\\n> again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the\\n> sustainability of strong natural gas prices.\\n>\\n>\\n\\n - 2001 Natural Gas Conference Call.doc\\n\\n', '23796358.1075857651180': 'my numbers from mar 15.  would raise jun-augy by 10 cents because of the \\nsupportive weather we had from mar 15-apr 15\\n\\n\\nFrom: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/19/2001 01:17 PM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: please fill in--i lost the scrap of paper\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tarnold\\nMay-01\\t455\\nJun-01\\t395\\nJul-01\\t370\\nAug-01\\t350\\nSep-01\\t350\\nOct-01\\t360\\nNov-01\\t360\\nDec-01\\t325\\nJan-02\\t280\\n\\t\\n\\nJen Fraser\\nEnron Global Markets Fundamentals\\n713-853-4759\\n\\n\\n', '729250.1075857601822': 'Kevin:\\nCome by Tuesday between 5:00-5:30 if you still want to see the new \\nspreadsheet.

For example,\\nprior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for\\nany new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the\\nClearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:\\n(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;\\n(b)  the account number;\\n(c)  the brokerage rate;\\n(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with\\nthe executing broker for that account; and\\n(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that\\naccount.\\nMoreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or\\nthe specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite\\nparty, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance\\nDepartment will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification\\nof such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.\\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard\\nPurta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)\\n299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at\\n(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance\\nSection, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,\\n\\nNEW RULE 9.11A (\"Give-Up Trades\")\\n\\n(Entire rule is new.)\\n\\nRule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades\\n\\nIn the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the\\nresponsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing\\nMembers, the following rules shall define the respective\\nresponsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The \"executing\\nbroker\", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member\\nFirm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.\\n\\n(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members\\n\\n(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its\\ndiscretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up\\nfor a customer\\'s account from an executing broker, provided however, that\\nthe executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the\\nClearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be\\nreceived by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice\\nshall be retained by the Clearing Member.\\n\\n(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (\"DK\") a trade only if:\\n(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of\\nthis rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing\\nbroker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for\\nwhich the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a\\nbasis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the\\nprovisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.\\n\\n(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred\\nfor all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and\\nsubsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.\\nFloor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing\\nMember, customer and the executing broker.\\n\\n(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers\\n\\n(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for\\ndetermining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once\\nan order has been accepted, a broker or the broker\\'s clerk must:\\n\\n(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;\\n(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;\\n(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as\\npracticable; and\\n(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as\\npracticable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.\\n\\n2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the\\nexecuting broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in\\nconnection with the broker\\'s obligations under these rules.  The executing\\nbroker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these\\nrules.\\n\\n3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member\\nAuthorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order\\nfor any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the\\nClearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:\\n(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;\\n(g)  the account number;\\n(h)  the brokerage rate;\\n(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with\\nthe executing broker for that account; and\\n(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that\\naccount.\\nThe executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the\\nspecifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,\\ndate, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such\\ninformation shall be the basis for disciplinary action.\\n\\n4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed\\nClearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in\\naccordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker\\'s\\ndiscretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for\\nexecution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing\\nMember(s) of any such rejection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Carr Futures\\n      150 S.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\\n\\nAcquiring a Company\\n\\n In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability\\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either\\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,\\nand so on.\\n\\n The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price\\nthey should offer for Company T\\'s shares.  This offer must be made now,\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press.\\n\\n Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project\\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\\nanything less than $50.\\n\\n As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T\\'s\\nstock?\\n\\n $______ per/share\\n\\n\\n', '28904100.1075857595915': \"Brian Hoskins is an analyst who rotated off the gas floor.\\nPete Keavey now reports to Scott Neal\\n\\nMy aa is Ina Rangel\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\tEnron North America Corp.\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  Tammy R Shepperd                           10/24/2000 08:06 AM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Gas Org Chart\\n\\nJohn, \\nDo you have any changes or vacancies?

Then it saw a better\\ndeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\\nunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is\\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\\npays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.\\nIt is a measure of this winter\\'s fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in\\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even\\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large\\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they\\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum\\nand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to\\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\\n\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don\\'t know\\nwhat they\\'re going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chief\\neconomist at Standard & Poor\\'s. Some economists have recently increased\\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter\\'s heating bills on\\nan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated\\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a\\ntypical U.S. household.\\nThat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\\nenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected\\ngrowth in the nation\\'s economic output by one percentage point on an annual\\nrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energy\\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\\nslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in\\nSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use\\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the\\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\\nDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,\\nwhich are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its\\nexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative\\nofficer.\\n\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, \\'This is crazy,\\' \" he said.\\nTerra hasn\\'t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but\\nRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra\\'s good\\nfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the\\nprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\\npoint. That would keep Terra\\'s plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate\\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"\\nRosenbury said, \"it\\'s going to be a real problem.\"\\nHe estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18\\nmillion tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn\\'t operating\\nnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It\\'s possible that\\nfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark\\nInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and\\ndistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,\\nindefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next\\nmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\\ncontinued production. \"We believe it\\'s likely this is a speculative bubble\\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we\\'ll be able to\\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said Paul\\nM. Murphy, the company\\'s managing director for financial planning. A\\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers\\' decisions to\\nplant feed corn, he said. \"It\\'s sticker shock.\"\\nAccording to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the\\naluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the\\nindustry\\'s No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O\\'Carroll, an\\nanalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.\\nAluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,\\nand December\\'s production will be lower still, he said. \"We\\'ll get more\\nproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and\\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\\nsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn\\'t fall completely apart, then\\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more\\nthan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser\\'s case, it\\'s an open question\\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually\\nentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,\\nsays spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville\\nfor $550 a megawatt hour for December.\\nBut the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future\\nprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,\\nto invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to\\nBonneville\\'s other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and\\nBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after\\nnext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries\\nto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Out\\nhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an\\nethical dimension to this and we\\'re not shy in trying to make sure they live\\nup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Mosey\\nsaid.\\n, 2000 The Washington Post Company\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '15815188.1075857649919': 'Kim:\\nI will not be at the may 18 management mtg as I will be in NY on business.', '28900563.1075857652063': 'http://gasmsgboard.corp.enron.com/msgframe.asp', '5508781.1075857658744': 'what is this???\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  Jennifer Fraser                           12/27/2000 12:19 PM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Bill Berkeland/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer \\nShipos/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: NG YEAR ENd Quiz\\n\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer Fraser/HOU/ECT on 27/12/2000 \\n18:21 ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nRBrown5658@aol.com@wwwww.aescon.com on 27/12/2000 12:04:03\\nSupplemental Bonus question: See no 12---- Is Jeff Shankman\\'s picture there\\n\\nHere is your year end NG quiz.

Just understand that he is \\nat a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade \\ncounterparty.\\n\\nI understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread \\noption he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the \\ntrading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that \\nEnron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This \\nwas one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing \\nmodels created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that \\nthey are strictly theoretical and don\\'t take into account gas fundamental \\nprice limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, \\nfor a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within \\nvariable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a \\ncorrelation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, \\nwe have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this \\nmethodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since \\nbeen changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very \\nfew non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  \\n\\nFinally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to \\nEnron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting \\ncredit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade \\nconsidering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.\\nThanks, \\nJohn', '7766659.1075857657949': \"I'll be there\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVince J Kaminski\\n01/12/2001 04:41 PM\\nTo: Fletcher J Sturm/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise \\nKitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christie \\nPatrick/HOU/ECT@ECT \\nSubject: Tiger Team meeting Jeff Shankman's office\\n\\nI would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday\\nJanuary 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.\\n\\nWe are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 \\nWharton School\\nstudents visiting Enron.

Soon he quit the millin=\\ng=20\\nbusiness and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o=\\nf=20\\nthe state. Before his death in 1930 he had built a utility that lit 56 Kans=\\nas=20\\ncommunities.=20\\nKansas City\\'s UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourth-generation=20\\nfamily-controlled electric utility in the country. Today the outfit, once=\\n=20\\ncalled Missouri Public Service, is headed by Lemuel Green\\'s two=20\\ngreat-grandsons.\\nRichard Green, 46, took over as chief executive in 1985, three years after=\\n=20\\nhis father\\'s death. At the time Missouri Public Service served 200,000=20\\ncustomers in two states and had $245 million in revenues. Richard\\'s brother=\\n=20\\nRobert, now 39, joined him three years later.=20\\nStanding pat was not an option. Deregulation was in the air, and the rules=\\n=20\\nwere changing. The brothers remade the company. They spent $4 billion buyin=\\ng=20\\nutilities in other parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.=20\\nUtiliCorp now serves 4 million customers in seven states and four countries=\\n.=20\\nMore important, they veered off into other parts of the energy business. In=\\n=20\\n1986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=\\n a=20\\ntwo-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading=\\n=20\\noperation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as=\\n=20\\nvaluable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,500 megawatts of power=\\n=20\\ngenerated in some 22 power plants around the country.=20\\n\"My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be=\\n=20\\ncompetitive in this business,\" says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,100=\\n=20\\nemployees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and Enron. According =\\nto=20\\nNatural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t=\\nhe=20\\ncountry last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin=\\ng=20\\nfrom weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20\\nProblem: Trading operations require capital just as power plants do. The=20\\nsolution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls \"our \\'asset lite\\'=20\\nstrategy. We want to control the capacity, not own it.\" So Aquila may provi=\\nde=20\\nthe gas to power a so-called merchant plant, one that produces electricity =\\nto=20\\nsell in the market, in return for a claim on its production. But so far=20\\nAquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20\\nbusiness-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way Enron and Dyneg=\\ny=20\\ndo.=20\\nWhat to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o=\\nf=20\\nAquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its=\\n=20\\ntrading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20\\nCompany are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o=\\nf=20\\n20 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul=\\nd=20\\nspin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20\\nThe timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20\\nmarket. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for=\\n=20\\nmany firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th=\\ne=20\\nreason UtiliCorp\\'s earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29=\\n=20\\nbillion in sales. UtiliCorp\\'s shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20\\nBut will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila=\\n=20\\nstock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in=\\n=20\\nthe capital markets forever. Even with its \"asset-lite\" strategy, the compa=\\nny=20\\nis far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20\\nversus the 50% norm for electric utilities. The offering is supposed to rai=\\nse=20\\n$425 million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent\\'s $2.=\\n9=20\\nbillion in debt.=20\\nIf Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope, you could never tell it by=\\n=20\\ntalking to him. \"We see this company as our heritage,\" he says confidently.=\\n=20\\nThis despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family\\'s share =\\nof=20\\nUtiliCorp is now 4%, down from 15% when Richard took over.=20\\nMight the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle? They might, but=\\n=20\\nthey might come out ahead anyway. Look at the family history.

But just=\\n=20\\nbefore he started working on a doctorate, a very different opportunity blew=\\n=20\\nin.=20\\nNow Mr. Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of M.B.A.s who trade=20\\nbillions of dollars in weather-sensitive energy commodities such as natural=\\n=20\\ngas and electricity for Aquila Inc., the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes=\\nt=20\\nutility.\\nWith no business background himself, Mr. Hoggatt is also trading complex=20\\nfinancial contracts based on his predictions. \"I\\'m putting my money where m=\\ny=20\\nmouth is,\" says the tall, square-shouldered 28-year-old.=20\\nWeathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding=20\\nenergy-trading business. While off-target forecasts on television may=20\\nfrustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians, as they did this=\\n=20\\nweek on the East Coast, they can lose bundles for electricity and natural-g=\\nas=20\\ntraders. So as trading has boomed, so has demand for trained meteorologists=\\n,=20\\na profession that traditionally hasn\\'t paid all that well and is often the=\\n=20\\nbutt of jokes.=20\\nFrom Wall Street to Houston\\'s Louisiana Street, where many energy companies=\\n=20\\nhave set up shop, recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a=\\nt=20\\nthe National Weather Service or in academia. \"The appetite for weather is=\\n=20\\ninsatiable,\" says James L. Gooding, director of meteorology at Duke Energy=\\n=20\\nCorp. A former NASA scientist, Dr. Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast=\\ner=20\\nto his Houston team in the next year.=20\\nEnron Corp., an energy-trading giant based in Houston, has more than double=\\nd=20\\nits staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years, plucking=\\n=20\\ntalent from places like the Weather Channel. Williams Cos., a Tulsa, Okla.,=\\n=20\\ncompetitor, is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students=\\n.=20\\nAnd since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas=\\n=20\\nCity, Mo., has hired two other meteorologists from Mr. Hoggatt\\'s alma mater=\\n,=20\\nthe University of Wisconsin, plus another scientist with a Ph.D. in=20\\nclimatology.=20\\nThat hiring paid off a bit during this week\\'s winter storm in the Northeast=\\n.=20\\nWhile many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a=\\n=20\\npending, possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other=20\\ncities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20\\nLast Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20\\nregion at Aquila, stopped by to see how the storm was progressing. Mr.=20\\nHoggatt\\'s team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low=\\ner=20\\nbecause of the storm, though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little=20\\nhigh. Sure enough, temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less=\\n=20\\nthan predicted, lifting electricity prices and making Mr. Macrorie a profit=\\n=20\\nthat he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars.=20\\nAbout 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor\\'=\\ns=20\\ndegrees in meteorology, according to the American Meteorological Society. A=\\nn=20\\nadditional 300 or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates. Until jus=\\nt=20\\na few years ago, those graduates didn\\'t typically have many options: TV for=\\n=20\\nthose who had the blow-dried look, back-office jobs with the government or =\\na=20\\nhandful of private consultants for those who didn\\'t. Research was an option=\\n.=20\\nAnd some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help=\\n=20\\nposition airplanes or power-line repair trucks during storms.=20\\nNow, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with=\\n=20\\ngraduate degrees salaries ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Performance and=\\n=20\\ntrading bonuses can double or even triple the figure. That compares with th=\\ne=20\\nroughly $33,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with =\\na=20\\ngraduate degree.=20\\n\"It\\'s a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative=20\\nemployment after graduation,\" says John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of=20\\natmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. \"This is a bit of a switch.\"=\\n=20\\nSo far, there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available, partly=\\n=20\\nbecause the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in=\\n=20\\nthe mid-1990s and slowed hiring. It hires only to replace people who leave,=\\n=20\\nabout 30 to 50 meteorologists a year.=20\\nAnd the high-pressure world of billion-dollar commodity bets isn\\'t for=20\\neveryone. When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State, one of the nation\\'s to=\\np=20\\nmeteorology programs, he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron. \"It\\'s quite an=\\n=20\\nimpressive place,\" he says of Enron\\'s trading floor, but he wasn\\'t sure=20\\nforecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade. \"I would be=20\\nafraid that if money wasn\\'t made in a hurry, I\\'d be tossed,\" says Mr. Altoe=\\n,=20\\nwho accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette, Mic=\\nh.=20\\nFor others, having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art. After=\\n=20\\ntwo years as a manager at the Weather Channel\\'s Latin American division in=\\n=20\\nAtlanta, Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the=\\n=20\\nAmerican Meteorological Society. Enron called.=20\\n\"Have you heard about Enron?\" Mr. Marquez remembers being asked. \"And I sai=\\nd,=20\\nhonestly, `No.\\'\"=20\\nDuring a visit, Mr. Marquez, a 33-year-old Navy-trained meteorologist, foun=\\nd=20\\nEnron\\'s trading floor exhilarating. Enron courted Mr. Marquez heavily,=20\\ntracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico.=\\n=20\\nMr. Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active=\\n=20\\nwork place he was looking for. Also, he\\'d be getting a 10% to 15% boost ove=\\nr=20\\nhis Weather Channel salary, before potential bonuses from Enron.=20\\n\"I\\'m getting more money than I would anywhere else,\" he says.=20\\nWeather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicago\\'s earl=\\ny=20\\ncommodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street. Jon=20\\nDavis, a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago, started=20\\nforecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in 1985.=20\\nBut volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are=\\n=20\\nable to gauge air-conditioning use in the summer or natural-gas demand duri=\\nng=20\\nthe winter heating season. Meanwhile, all sorts of companies are turning to=\\n=20\\nenergy traders and Wall Street for \"weather derivatives,\" complex contracts=\\n=20\\nused to hedge financial risks associated with the weather. \"With every=20\\npassing year, you do more energy and more energy,\" Mr. Davis says.=20\\nDespite big advances in data collection and modeling, betting millions of=\\n=20\\ndollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business. Short-term=20\\nforecasts are pretty good. Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy.=\\n=20\\nMost meteorologists get their data from the government, particularly the=20\\nNational Weather Service. Many then tweak it with their own interpretations=\\n=20\\nor forecasting models.=20\\nDisappointed last year by poor long-term forecasts from 11 private=20\\nconsultants, Aquila has a contest offering $100,000 to the meteorologist or=\\n=20\\nteam that can best predict temperatures in 13 major U.S. cities over the=20\\ncourse of a year. \"I call it the forecast bakeoff,\" says Mr. Hoggatt.=20\\nThe high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters. WSI Corp., a=20\\nBillerica, Mass., weather-forecasting firm, started an energy service last=\\n=20\\nyear, and Jeffrey A. Shorter, a WSI vice president, says energy clients can=\\n=20\\nbe less forgiving than his other clients in TV and aviation, especially whe=\\nn=20\\nthe forecasts are wrong.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\\n\\nAcquiring a Company\\n\\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T\\'s shares\\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\\nviability\\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\\neither\\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\\nA,\\nand so on.\\n\\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\\nprice\\nthey should offer for Company T\\'s shares.  This offer must be made now,\\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\\nthe press.\\n\\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\\nproject\\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\\nanything less than $50.\\n\\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\\noffers\\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T\\'s\\nstock?\\n\\n     $______ per/share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '9855848.1075857597735': \"I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, \\nbandwidth).

It now looks as if it will get done in the \\nnext 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken \\ncare of. \\n\\nIn brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and \\nCNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against \\nthe Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from \\nDecember, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from \\nroughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is \\n17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the \\nproducers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with \\nmore details. \\n\\nThere are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to \\nclarify. \\n\\nFirst, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like \\npayment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both \\nthe floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the \\nDecember settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment \\nwould take place on February 15, 2000. \\n\\nSecond, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. \\nApparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and \\nCredit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we \\nwould be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron \\nCorp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. \\n(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've \\ndone with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). \\n\\n There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with \\nthe aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with \\nEnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. \\nHowever, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this \\ntransaction.\\n\\nCSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split \\nit among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting \\nwith Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. \\nIdeally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end \\nof this week. \\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.\\n\\nRegards,\\nRuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\", '645203.1075857652474': 'do you still have the magazine and if so can you send it to me?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Zerilli, Frank\" <fzerilli@POWERMERCHANTS.COM> on 03/23/2001 12:05:51 PM\\nTo: \"\\'jarnold@enron.com\\'\" <jarnold@enron.com>\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Jarnold\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Jarnold\\n\\n - Jarnold.jpg\\n\\n', '30262076.1075857652691': \"i talked to fred today.  i think he's in so lets assume it's a go.   when is \\nthe last day to cancel and get our money back?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIna Rangel\\n04/04/2001 11:14 AM\\nTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Miami\\n\\nJohn,\\n\\nIt looks like Fred is not going to do the Miami trip after all.
